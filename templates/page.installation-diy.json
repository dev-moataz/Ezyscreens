Gentle, circular motions do the trick without damaging the mesh or frame.</p><h3><strong>Fresh Screens in Minutes - The Ezy Way</strong></h3><p>Once wiped down, rinse with a clean cloth or light hose spray (low pressure only) and let the screens completely air dry before retracting back into the cassette. Regular dusting and gentle cleaning keep your retractable fly screens looking fresh and working smoothly year-round - no removal, no stress.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Live in an art deco home? Different types of architrave mouldings on your door or window frame can affect the installation process of your DIY retractable fly screens.  As architrave mouldings are usually ornate and have different depths, it's essential to choose which depth layer you would like to fit your mesh screen. Consider the following installation tips: </p><ul><li>The Jamb/frame/moulding depth of at least 35mmD on the top and sides of the frame.</li><li>The bottom of the architrave moulding or the floor on the plane of this layer must be flat, or show a depth of over 20mmD.</li><li>There are no obstructions such as window hardware or alarm system control boxes on the plane of this layer. </li></ul><p>Once you select the layer of the architrave on where you want your DIY fly screen to go, you can begin to measure the width and height of the opening. We suggest measuring the height of the opening at both ends and same with the width. </p><p>Interested in Ezy’s screens cost-effective solutions?
